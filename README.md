### Unsupervised Machine Learning Challenge

## General Information
In this challenge I used Dimensionality Reduction and cluster analysis to apply unsupervised machine learning to a dataset. I started by importing the data then applying Dimensionality Reduction. I did this by doing the PCA and T-SNE methods to further reduce the dataset. I then did a cluster analysis by finding K-means and created a elbow curve.
